    "Trips are one of the most popular ideas to spend a vacation. Such tourist centers as Paris, Prague or Rome are visited annually by many millions of tourists. At the same time these cities are centers of business and of course target of many business trips. People may have many different purposes of new city visiting. Somebody like the most to see sights, somebody wants to find excellent local restaurant, and somebody dreams on walk along the promenade. People who arrived on business trip may need banks, administrative institutions etc. How do we select a hotel or apartments? Usually we look through popular booking sites (these companies have not pay me, so I’ll skip names of popular services). These sites collect information about our activities. Registered users could see the history of their bookings. So it’s possible to give advice to customers based on their previous experience. Who could be interested in such a service? Both sides – travelers and booking services have their own necessity in such a service. Imagine, you are going to new city and site propose you “Please select the best 5 your previous booking places and we will find you a similar place for the next booking in new city”. It’s convenient, you will save a lot of time. Booking services may consider this feature as a competitive advantage."

    "Does described technic could be useful for booking place selection? Surely, it could be improved. Aim of the trip (business or vacation), hotel prices in some neighborhood are also very important features. But venues around the hotels are really important part of good trip. And it's very hard to determine a good place in totally new city. So this capstone result is not sufficient to select good hotel but could be a first step to create a tool than could be useful for booking companies. "
